Dutch Blockchain Hackathon
Project SPARC – Empowering Privacy with AI-Driven Compliance.

🔐 Solution: A 3-layered guardian system for selective disclosure on-chain:
 1️⃣ Decentralized monitoring with AI agents issuing real-time compliance flags
 2️⃣ Gatekeeping layer applying quorum logic for transparency and fairness
 3️⃣ Guardians in Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) issuing disclosure only under valid warrants
⚖️ Addressed the challenge of “Trust Through Transparency – or at the Cost of It?” with a privacy-first, MiCA-compliant architecture that protects both AI models and users, with:
1. Soulbound tokens for identity & reputation
2. Guardian incentives (hybrid tokenomics)
3. Ensemble models predicting AML/KYC breaches
